# Unicode browser with wikipedia integration

unicode.wiki is a fully indexed, browsable and searchable dictionary of unicode characters spanning the basic and supplementary unicode planes. The project attempts to render all codepoints using sourced fonts, however in some cases you will see either a blank rendering or the missing glyph character `û∏Å`. Integration with wikipedia.org is implemeted though the https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1 page api and https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php search api. Not all codepoints have a wiki page.

The idea behind the project has been lurking inside me for some years now, and was born out of an interest in unicode, World travel and the origin or languages.

I also wanted to experiment with the idea of organizing repos in a monorepo and decided to use this as a means of testing out Lerna and yarn workspaces. The excercise has taught me a lot! and I will share the love in an upcoming blog. 

In addition, time allowing and given enough interest, I will create a tutorial covering the design/development and deployment to kubernetes... star/watch if you are interested.

* Further documentation
* Further test coverage
* Improved elasticsearch index
* Improved messaging
* Addtional integration via google search and youtube
* Persist codepoints to a favorite list
* Generate/export font from list of codepoints
* Any community feedback...

## Disclaimer

This project is very early beta stage and serves as a proof of concept/exploration of Lerna monorepos. SHould you find any bugs please docreate an issue/pr

# Local dev installation

If you already have mongo and elasticsearch running locally, skip ahead..

To quckly get a mongo/easticsearch environment up and running 

```
./compose up
```

`compose.sh up` will install and make available the following containers:

* mongo on localhost:27017
* elasticsearch on localhost:9200
* kibana on localhost:5601
* logstash on localhost:5000

Edit `compose.sh` if you do not want/require kibana/logstash

```
  docker-compose \
    -f ./.docker-compose/mongo.yml \
    -f ./.docker-compose/elastic-search.yml \
    -f ./.docker-compose/kibana.yml \
    -f ./.docker-compose/logstash.yml \
```

To cleanup when you are done:

```
# shut down composed services
./compose.sh down
```



# Starting the services

If you are not running mongo/elasticsearch on the following addresses, update the config in `.env`

* mongo on localhost:27017
* elasticsearch on localhost:9200

```
# compile the source
yarn bootstrap

# run the web app/api server
yarn dev 

# if you want to make edits with live reload
yarn watch

# alternatively run the production server
yarn start 

# seed the dbs
# one time operation - seed data is persisted to disk
yarn seed
```

That's all for now... Comments/questions welcome. Thank you for reading.
