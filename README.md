# Unicode Browser with Wikipedia integration

## Background and motivation

unicode.wiki is a fully indexed, browsable and searchable disctionary of unicode characters spanning the basic and supplementory places. The project attempts to render all codepoints using sourced fonts, however in some cases you will see either a blank rendering or the `missing glyph` character û∏Å. Integration with wikipedia.org is implemeted though the https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1 page api and https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php search api. Not all codepoints have a wiki page.

The idea behind the project has been lurking inside me for some years now, and was born out of an interest in unicode, languages and the origin or languages.

I also wanted to experiment with the idea of organising repos into a monorepo and decided to use this as a means of testing out Lerna and yarn workspaces. The experience has taught me a lot and I hope to share my experience in an upcoming blog. In addition, time allowing and given enough interest, I intend to create a tutorial covering the design/development and deployment to kubernetes. Please star/watch if you are interested.

## Project features

* Indexed and searchable dictionary disctionary of unicode characters spanning the basic and supplementory places sourced from http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/
* Browsable codepoints categorized following the unicode charts spec http://www.unicode.org/charts
* Integration with wikipedia.org via api's
* Mobile first design allowing functional browsing from any device

## Technology used

see above...

## Future enhancement

Given time/resources I will be adding new features

* Documentation
* Test coverage
* Further integration with google search and youtube
* Persist codepoints to a favorite list
* Generate/export font from list of codepoints

# Local dev installation

If you already have mongo and elasticsearch running locally, skip ahead..

To quicly get a mongo/easticsearch environment running locally

```
./compose up
```

`compose.sh up` will install the following containers:

* mongo on localhost:27017
* elasticsearch on localhost:0200
* kibana on localhost:5601
* logstash on localhost:500

Edit `compose.sh` if you do not want/require kibana/logstash

```
  docker-compose \
    -f ./.docker-compose/mongo.yml \
    -f ./.docker-compose/elastic-search.yml \
    -f ./.docker-compose/kibana.yml \
    -f ./.docker-compose/logstash.yml \
```

To cleanup after yourself:

```
./compose.sh down
```

# Running dev installation

```
# compile the source
yarn bootstrap

# run the development server
yarn dev 

# if you want to make edits with live reload
yarn watch

# alternatively run the production server
yarn start 

# seed the dbs
# this only needs to be done one time as the data in persisted to disk.
yarn seed
```
